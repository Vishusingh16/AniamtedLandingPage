        <p className="text">I am excited to apply for the Job. As a passionate and results-driven developer, I bring a strong foundation in  frontend development, Unity development, Golang, Spring Boot, along with hands-on experience in building efficient and scalable applications.

          During my tenure as a Product Engineer at Cybernetyx, I worked extensively on C# and Unity, developing interactive applications and optimizing game performance. Additionally, my experience at Coding Samurai as a Frontend Developer Intern allowed me to refine my skills in React.js and Tailwind CSS, building user-friendly interfaces. My diverse background in game development, web technologies, and software engineering enables me to adapt quickly and contribute effectively to dynamic projects.

          My ability to collaborate in teams, solve complex problems, and deliver high-quality solutions aligns well with your organization's vision. I am eager to leverage my skills to contribute to your teamâ€™s success.
